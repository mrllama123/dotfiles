# C\# global classes

Global classes (also known as named scripts) are types registered in Godot's
editor so they can be used more conveniently.
[In GDScript](../gdscript/gdscript_basics.md#doc-gdscript-basics-class-name), this is achieved
using the `class_name` keyword at the top of a script. This page describes how
to achieve the same effect in C#.

- Global classes show up in the _Add Node_ and _Create Resource_ dialogs.

- If an [exported property](c_sharp_exports.md#doc-c-sharp-exports) is a global class, the
inspector restricts assignment, allowing only instances of that global class
or any derived classes.


Global classes are registered with the `[GlobalClass]` attribute.

```
using Godot;

[GlobalClass]
public partial class MyNode : Node
{
}

```

Warning

The file name must match the class name in **case-sensitive** fashion.
For example, a global class named "MyNode" must have a file name of
`MyNode.cs`, not `myNode.cs`.

The `MyNode` type will be registered as a global class with the same name as the type's name.

![../../../_images/globalclasses_addnode.webp](../../../_images/globalclasses_addnode.webp)

The _Select a Node_ window for the `MyNode` exported property filters the list
of nodes in the scene to match the assignment restriction.

```
public partial class Main : Node
{
    [Export]
    public MyNode MyNode { get; set; }
}

```

![../../../_images/globalclasses_exportednode.webp](../../../_images/globalclasses_exportednode.webp)

If a custom type isn't registered as a global class, the assignment is
restricted to the Godot type the custom type is based on. For example, inspector
assignments to an export of the type `MySimpleSprite2D` are restricted to
`Sprite2D` and derived types.

```
public partial class MySimpleSprite2D : Sprite2D
{
}

```

When combined with the `[GlobalClass]` attribute, the `[Icon]` attribute
allows providing a path to an icon to show when the class is displayed in the
editor.

```
using Godot;

[GlobalClass, Icon("res://Stats/StatsIcon.svg")]
public partial class Stats : Resource
{
    [Export]
    public int Strength { get; set; }

    [Export]
    public int Defense { get; set; }

    [Export]
    public int Speed { get; set; }
}

```

![../../../_images/globalclasses_createresource.webp](../../../_images/globalclasses_createresource.webp)

The `Stats` class is a custom resource registered as a global class. [Exporting properties](c_sharp_exports.md#doc-c-sharp-exports) of the
type `Stats` will only allow instances of this resource type to be assigned, and the inspector
will let you create and load instances of this type easily.

Warning

The Godot editor will hide these custom classes with names that begin with the prefix
"Editor" in the "Create New Node" or "Create New Scene" dialog windows. The classes
are available for instantiation at runtime via their class names, but are
automatically hidden by the editor windows along with the built-in editor nodes used
by the Godot editor.
