# Scene organization

This article covers topics related to the effective organization of
scene content. Which nodes should you use? Where should you place them?
How should they interact?

## How to build relationships effectively

When Godot users begin crafting their own scenes, they often run into the
following problem:

They create their first scene and fill it with content only to eventually end
up saving branches of their scene into separate scenes as the nagging feeling
that they should split things up starts to accumulate. However, they then
notice that the hard references they were able to rely on before are no longer
possible. Re-using the scene in multiple places creates issues because the
node paths do not find their targets and signal connections established in the
editor break.

To fix these problems, you must instantiate the sub-scenes without them
requiring details about their environment. You need to be able to trust
that the sub-scene will create itself without being picky about how it's used.

One of the biggest things to consider in OOP is maintaining
focused, singular-purpose classes with
[loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling)
to other parts of the codebase. This keeps the size of objects small (for
maintainability) and improves their reusability.

These OOP best practices have _several_ implications for best practices
in scene structure and script usage.

**If at all possible, you should design scenes to have no dependencies.**
That is, you should create scenes that keep everything they need within
themselves.

If a scene must interact with an external context, experienced developers
recommend the use of
[Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection).
This technique involves having a high-level API provide the dependencies of the
low-level API. Why do this? Because classes which rely on their external
environment can inadvertently trigger bugs and unexpected behavior.

To do this, you must expose data and then rely on a parent context to
initialize it:

1. Connect to a signal. Extremely safe, but should be used only to "respond" to
behavior, not start it. By convention, signal names are usually past-tense verbs
like "entered", "skill\_activated", or "item\_collected".



GDScriptC#C++









```
# Parent
$Child.signal_name.connect(method_on_the_object)

# Child
signal_name.emit() # Triggers parent-defined behavior.

```















```
// Parent
GetNode("Child").Connect("SignalName", Callable.From(ObjectWithMethod.MethodOnTheObject));

// Child
EmitSignal("SignalName"); // Triggers parent-defined behavior.

```















```
// Parent
Node *node = get_node<Node>("Child");
if (node != nullptr) {
       // Note that get_node may return a nullptr, which would make calling the connect method crash the engine if "Child" does not exist!
       // So unless you are 1000% sure get_node will never return a nullptr, it's a good idea to always do a nullptr check.
       node->connect("signal_name", callable_mp(this, &ObjectWithMethod::method_on_the_object));
}

// Child
emit_signal("signal_name"); // Triggers parent-defined behavior.

```

2. Call a method. Used to start behavior.



GDScriptC#C++









```
# Parent
$Child.method_name = "do"

# Child, assuming it has String property 'method_name' and method 'do'.
call(method_name) # Call parent-defined method (which child must own).

```















```
// Parent
GetNode("Child").Set("MethodName", "Do");

// Child
Call(MethodName); // Call parent-defined method (which child must own).

```















```
// Parent
Node *node = get_node<Node>("Child");
if (node != nullptr) {
       node->set("method_name", "do");
}

// Child
call(method_name); // Call parent-defined method (which child must own).

```

3. Initialize a [Callable](../../classes/class_callable.md#class-callable) property. Safer than a method
as ownership of the method is unnecessary. Used to start behavior.



GDScriptC#C++









```
# Parent
$Child.func_property = object_with_method.method_on_the_object

# Child
func_property.call() # Call parent-defined method (can come from anywhere).

```















```
// Parent
GetNode("Child").Set("FuncProperty", Callable.From(ObjectWithMethod.MethodOnTheObject));

// Child
FuncProperty.Call(); // Call parent-defined method (can come from anywhere).

```















```
// Parent
Node *node = get_node<Node>("Child");
if (node != nullptr) {
       node->set("func_property", Callable(&ObjectWithMethod::method_on_the_object));
}

// Child
func_property.call(); // Call parent-defined method (can come from anywhere).

```

4. Initialize a Node or other Object reference.



GDScriptC#C++









```
# Parent
$Child.target = self

# Child
print(target) # Use parent-defined node.

```















```
// Parent
GetNode("Child").Set("Target", this);

// Child
GD.Print(Target); // Use parent-defined node.

```















```
// Parent
Node *node = get_node<Node>("Child");
if (node != nullptr) {
       node->set("target", this);
}

// Child
UtilityFunctions::print(target);

```

5. Initialize a NodePath.



GDScriptC#C++









```
# Parent
$Child.target_path = ".."

# Child
get_node(target_path) # Use parent-defined NodePath.

```















```
// Parent
GetNode("Child").Set("TargetPath", NodePath(".."));

// Child
GetNode(TargetPath); // Use parent-defined NodePath.

```















```
// Parent
Node *node = get_node<Node>("Child");
if (node != nullptr) {
       node->set("target_path", NodePath(".."));
}

// Child
get_node<Node>(target_path); // Use parent-defined NodePath.

```


These options hide the points of access from the child node. This in turn
keeps the child **loosely coupled** to its environment. You can reuse it
in another context without any extra changes to its API.

Note

Although the examples above illustrate parent-child relationships,
the same principles apply towards all object relations. Nodes which
are siblings should only be aware of their own hierarchies while an ancestor
mediates their communications and references.

GDScriptC#C++

```
# Parent
$Left.target = $Right.get_node("Receiver")

# Left
var target: Node
func execute():
    # Do something with 'target'.

# Right
func _init():
    var receiver = Receiver.new()
    add_child(receiver)

```

```
// Parent
GetNode<Left>("Left").Target = GetNode("Right/Receiver");

public partial class Left : Node
{
    public Node Target = null;

    public void Execute()
    {
        // Do something with 'Target'.
    }
}

public partial class Right : Node
{
    public Node Receiver = null;

    public Right()
    {
        Receiver = ResourceLoader.Load<Script>("Receiver.cs").New();
        AddChild(Receiver);
    }
}

```

```
// Parent
get_node<Left>("Left")->target = get_node<Node>("Right/Receiver");

class Left : public Node {
    GDCLASS(Left, Node)

    protected:
        static void _bind_methods() {}

    public:
        Node *target = nullptr;

        Left() {}

        void execute() {
            // Do something with 'target'.
        }
};

class Right : public Node {
    GDCLASS(Right, Node)

    protected:
        static void _bind_methods() {}

    public:
        Node *receiver = nullptr;

        Right() {
            receiver = memnew(Node);
            add_child(receiver);
        }
};

```

The same principles also apply to non-Node objects that maintain dependencies
on other objects. Whichever object owns the other objects should manage
the relationships between them.

Warning

You should favor keeping data in-house (internal to a scene), though, as
placing a dependency on an external context, even a loosely coupled one,
still means that the node will expect something in its environment to be
true. The project's design philosophies should prevent this from happening.
If not, the code's inherent liabilities will force developers to use
documentation to keep track of object relations on a microscopic scale; this
is otherwise known as development hell. Writing code that relies on external
documentation to use it safely is error-prone by default.

To avoid creating and maintaining such documentation, you convert the
dependent node ("child" above) into a tool script that implements
`_get_configuration_warnings()`.
Returning a non-empty PackedStringArray from it will make the Scene dock generate a
warning icon with the string(s) as a tooltip by the node. This is the same icon
that appears for nodes such as the
[Area2D](../../classes/class_area2d.md#class-area2d) node when it has no child
[CollisionShape2D](../../classes/class_collisionshape2d.md#class-collisionshape2d) nodes defined. The editor
then self-documents the scene through the script code. No content duplication
via documentation is necessary.

A GUI like this can better inform project users of critical information about
a Node. Does it have external dependencies? Have those dependencies been
satisfied? Other programmers, and especially designers and writers, will need
clear instructions in the messages telling them what to do to configure it.

So, why does all this complex switcheroo work? Well, because scenes operate
best when they operate alone. If unable to work alone, then working with
others anonymously (with minimal hard dependencies, i.e. loose coupling)
is the next best thing. Inevitably, changes may need to be made to a class, and
if these changes cause it to interact with other scenes in unforeseen ways,
then things will start to break down. The whole point of all this indirection
is to avoid ending up in a situation where changing one class results in
adversely affecting other classes dependent on it.

Scripts and scenes, as extensions of engine classes, should abide
by _all_ OOP principles. Examples include...

- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

- [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

- [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

- [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)


## Choosing a node tree structure

You might start to work on a game but get overwhelmed by the vast possibilities
before you. You might know what you want to do, what systems you want to
have, but _where_ do you put them all? How you go about making your game
is always up to you. You can construct node trees in countless ways.
If you are unsure, this guide can give you a sample of a decent structure to
start with.

A game should always have an "entry point"; somewhere you can definitively
track where things begin so that you can follow the logic as it continues
elsewhere. It also serves as a bird's eye view of all other data and logic
in the program. For traditional applications, this is normally a "main"
function. In Godot, it's a Main node.

> - Node "Main" (main.gd)

The `main.gd` script will serve as the primary controller of your game.

Then you have an in-game "World" (a 2D or 3D one). This can be a child
of Main. In addition, you will need a primary GUI for your game that manages
the various menus and widgets the project needs.

> - Node "Main" (main.gd)
>
> - Node2D/Node3D "World" (game\_world.gd)
>
> - Control "GUI" (gui.gd)

When changing levels, you can then swap out the children of the "World" node.
[Changing scenes manually](../scripting/change_scenes_manually.md#doc-change-scenes-manually) gives you full
control over how your game world transitions.

The next step is to consider what gameplay systems your project requires.
If you have a system that...

1. tracks all of its data internally

2. should be globally accessible

3. should exist in isolation


... then you should create an [autoload 'singleton' node](../scripting/singletons_autoload.md#doc-singletons-autoload).

Note

For smaller games, a simpler alternative with less control would be to have
a "Game" singleton that simply calls the
[SceneTree.change\_scene\_to\_file()](../../classes/class_scenetree.md#class-scenetree-method-change-scene-to-file) method
to swap out the main scene's content. This structure more or less keeps
the "World" as the main game node.

Any GUI would also need to be either a singleton, a transitory part of the
"World", or manually added as a direct child of the root. Otherwise, the
GUI nodes would also delete themselves during scene transitions.

If you have systems that modify other systems' data, you should define those as
their own scripts or scenes, rather than autoloads. For more information, see
[Autoloads versus regular nodes](autoloads_versus_internal_nodes.md#doc-autoloads-versus-internal-nodes).

Each subsystem within your game should have its own section within the
SceneTree. You should use parent-child relationships only in cases where nodes
are effectively elements of their parents. Does removing the parent reasonably
mean that the children should also be removed? If not, then it should have its
own place in the hierarchy as a sibling or some other relation.

Note

In some cases, you need these separated nodes to _also_ position themselves
relative to each other. You can use the
[RemoteTransform](../../classes/class_remotetransform3d.md#class-remotetransform3d) /
[RemoteTransform2D](../../classes/class_remotetransform2d.md#class-remotetransform2d) nodes for this purpose.
They will allow a target node to conditionally inherit selected transform
elements from the Remote\* node. To assign the `target` [NodePath](../../classes/class_nodepath.md#class-nodepath), use one of the following:

1. A reliable third party, likely a parent node, to mediate the assignment.

2. A group, to pull a reference to the desired node (assuming there
will only ever be one of the targets).


When you should do this is subjective. The dilemma arises when you must
micro-manage when a node must move around the SceneTree to preserve
itself. For example...

- Add a "player" node to a "room".

- Need to change rooms, so you must delete the current room.

- Before the room can be deleted, you must preserve and/or move the player.

If memory is not a concern, you can...


  - Create the new room.

  - Move the player to the new room.

  - Delete the old room.


If memory is a concern, instead you will need to...

  - Move the player somewhere else in the tree.

  - Delete the room.

  - Instantiate and add the new room.

  - Re-add the player to the new room.

The issue is that the player here is a "special case" where the
developers must _know_ that they need to handle the player this way for the
project. The only way to reliably share this information as a team
is to _document_ it. Keeping implementation details in documentation is
dangerous. It's a maintenance burden, strains code readability, and
unnecessarily bloats the intellectual content of a project.

In a more complex game with larger assets, it can be a better idea to keep
the player somewhere else in the SceneTree entirely. This results in:

1. More consistency.

2. No "special cases" that must be documented and maintained somewhere.

3. No opportunity for errors to occur because these details are not accounted
for.


In contrast, if you ever need a child node that does _not_ inherit
the transform of its parent, you have the following options:

1. The **declarative** solution: place a [Node](../../classes/class_node.md#class-node) in between
them. Since it doesn't have a transform, they won't pass this information
to its children.

2. The **imperative** solution: Use the `top_level` property for the
[CanvasItem](../../classes/class_canvasitem.md#class-canvasitem-property-top-level) or
[Node3D](../../classes/class_node3d.md#class-node3d-property-top-level) node. This will make
the node ignore its inherited transform.


Note

If building a networked game, keep in mind which nodes and gameplay systems
are relevant to all players versus those just pertinent to the authoritative
server. For example, users do not all need to have a copy of every players'
"PlayerController" logic - they only need their own. Keeping them in a
separate branch from the "world" can help simplify the management of game
connections and the like.

The key to scene organization is to consider the SceneTree in relational terms
rather than spatial terms. Are the nodes dependent on their parent's existence?
If not, then they can thrive all by themselves somewhere else.
If they are dependent, then it stands to reason that they should be children of
that parent (and likely part of that parent's scene if they aren't already).

Does this mean nodes themselves are components? Not at all.
Godot's node trees form an aggregation relationship, not one of composition.
But while you still have the flexibility to move nodes around, it is still best
when such moves are unnecessary by default.
