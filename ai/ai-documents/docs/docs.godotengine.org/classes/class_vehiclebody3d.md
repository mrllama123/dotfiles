# VehicleBody3D

**Inherits:** [RigidBody3D](class_rigidbody3d.md#class-rigidbody3d) **<** [PhysicsBody3D](class_physicsbody3d.md#class-physicsbody3d) **<** [CollisionObject3D](class_collisionobject3d.md#class-collisionobject3d) **<** [Node3D](class_node3d.md#class-node3d) **<** [Node](class_node.md#class-node) **<** [Object](class_object.md#class-object)

A 3D physics body that simulates the behavior of a car.

## Description

This physics body implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. Aside from a [CollisionShape3D](class_collisionshape3d.md#class-collisionshape3d) for the main body of the vehicle, you must also add a [VehicleWheel3D](class_vehiclewheel3d.md#class-vehiclewheel3d) node for each wheel. You should also add a [MeshInstance3D](class_meshinstance3d.md#class-meshinstance3d) to this node for the 3D model of the vehicle, but this model should generally not include meshes for the wheels. You can control the vehicle by using the [brake](#class-vehiclebody3d-property-brake), [engine\_force](#class-vehiclebody3d-property-engine-force), and [steering](#class-vehiclebody3d-property-steering) properties. The position or orientation of this node shouldn't be changed directly.

**Note:** The local forward for this node is [Vector3.MODEL\_FRONT](class_vector3.md#class-vector3-constant-model-front).

**Note:** The origin point of your VehicleBody3D will determine the center of gravity of your vehicle. To make the vehicle more grounded, the origin point is usually kept low, moving the [CollisionShape3D](class_collisionshape3d.md#class-collisionshape3d) and [MeshInstance3D](class_meshinstance3d.md#class-meshinstance3d) upwards.

**Note:** This class has known issues and isn't designed to provide realistic 3D vehicle physics. If you want advanced vehicle physics, you may have to write your own physics integration using [CharacterBody3D](class_characterbody3d.md#class-characterbody3d) or [RigidBody3D](class_rigidbody3d.md#class-rigidbody3d).

## Property Descriptions

[float](class_float.md#class-float) **brake** = `0.0` [🔗](#class-vehiclebody3d-property-brake)

- void **set\_brake**(value: [float](class_float.md#class-float))

- [float](class_float.md#class-float) **get\_brake**()


Slows down the vehicle by applying a braking force. The vehicle is only slowed down if the wheels are in contact with a surface. The force you need to apply to adequately slow down your vehicle depends on the [RigidBody3D.mass](class_rigidbody3d.md#class-rigidbody3d-property-mass) of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 30 range for hard braking.

* * *

[float](class_float.md#class-float) **engine\_force** = `0.0` [🔗](#class-vehiclebody3d-property-engine-force)

- void **set\_engine\_force**(value: [float](class_float.md#class-float))

- [float](class_float.md#class-float) **get\_engine\_force**()


Accelerates the vehicle by applying an engine force. The vehicle is only sped up if the wheels that have [VehicleWheel3D.use\_as\_traction](class_vehiclewheel3d.md#class-vehiclewheel3d-property-use-as-traction) set to `true` and are in contact with a surface. The [RigidBody3D.mass](class_rigidbody3d.md#class-rigidbody3d-property-mass) of the vehicle has an effect on the acceleration of the vehicle. For a vehicle with a mass set to 1000, try a value in the 25 - 50 range for acceleration.

**Note:** The simulation does not take the effect of gears into account, you will need to add logic for this if you wish to simulate gears.

A negative value will result in the vehicle reversing.

[float](class_float.md#class-float) **steering** = `0.0` [🔗](#class-vehiclebody3d-property-steering)

- void **set\_steering**(value: [float](class_float.md#class-float))

- [float](class_float.md#class-float) **get\_steering**()


The steering angle for the vehicle. Setting this to a non-zero value will result in the vehicle turning when it's moving. Wheels that have [VehicleWheel3D.use\_as\_steering](class_vehiclewheel3d.md#class-vehiclewheel3d-property-use-as-steering) set to `true` will automatically be rotated.

**Note:** This property is edited in the inspector in degrees. In code the property is set in radians.
